==================

Database Delete Operations Module

Purpose:
This module provides basic delete operations for MySQL tables.

Why this module exists:
In ETL pipelines, sometimes we need to:
1. Delete old records before reprocessing data
2. Clean staging tables before loading fresh data
3. Remove corrupted or duplicate records
4. Perform incremental load cleanup

Currently, this module is kept for future extensibility.
It can be used when delete operations are required in the pipeline.
